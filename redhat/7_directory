Create a collaboration directory

/home/managers with the following characteristics:

The group permissions for /home/managers are sysmgrs.

The directory should be read, write, and accessible by members of sysmgrs, but not by any other user. 
(Of course, the root user has access to all files and directories on the system).

Files created in /home/managers automatically set group ownership to the sysmgrs group.



mkdir /home/managers
 
chown root:sysmgrs /home/managers

chmod 070 /home/managers
chmod g=rwx,o=- /home/managers

chmod g+s /home/managers/

cd /home/managers/
touch file

-rw-r--r--. 1 root sysmgrs 0 May 14 18:27 file
